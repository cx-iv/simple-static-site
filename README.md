## 📓 about 📓

purely a project for the hell of it - but i do intend to build on the base "library" component of this site

this site is driven by four functions and a library that details how to handle all generation, events, etc.

this site could be built through a spreadsheet configuration that defines CSS classes and the "library" component

## 🛠️ implementation 🛠️
